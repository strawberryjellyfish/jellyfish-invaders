## Jellyfish Invaders

A plugin for WordPress that adds animated retro space invaders to any page of a WordPress website. Just a bit of fun!

## Example

Live demo at http://strawberryjellyfish.com/wordpress-plugins/jellyfish-invaders

## Installation

If you want to actually use this on a WordPress site it will be
easier to just install via the WordPress plugin admin pages.
Just search for Jellyfish Invaders and install.

If you want to install manually, create a folder in called jellyfish-invaders in your wp-plugins folder then copy the contents of trunk into it. Then go to the plugins page on your WordPress admin and activate.

## Further info

Consult the main readme in trunk or take a look at the plugin homepage at http://strawberryjellyfish.com/wordpress-plugins/jellyfish-invaders

## Want to contribute?

Feel free to use github to fork or pull request, the main WordPress SVN repository is just a mirror of this as I prefer to use git for many uninteresting reasons :)
